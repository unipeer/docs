# Basics 💡

Unipeer is a trustless and completely decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) exchange,
allowing anyone to buy and sell crypto in exchange for fiat.

## Why Unipeer

Current P2P marketplaces and fiat on-ramps (such as localcryptos.com) 
are not sufficiently decentralized and all have a manual arbitration
mechanism where the platforms team member resolve any payment dispute.

With Unipeer, we have:
* Improved UX by having only stable coin and Fiat pairs such as DAI/USD, cEUR/EUR, jJPY/JPY, ibAUD/AUD
* Off-chain fiat payment via p2p traditional payment methods like PayPal,
  Cash.app, UPI, etc
* Completely decentralized on-chain dispute resolution with aligned incentives

## Key Features

### Stable Coins
With the goal of being a Fiat on-ramp we greatly simplify the users buying
experience by only have stable coin pairs. New users are not intimidated by 
trading charts and fluctuating prices of assets.

Once a user is on-boarded to web3 and wishes to buy more volatile assets, they can do
so via the various excellent AMM exchanges.

To solve the problem of users having to pay the gas fees in a chain's native
asset, Unipeer smart contracts are written to accept meta-transactions,
letting them use a relay that accepts their fees in a stablecoin instead.

### No Intermediaries
Once an order is place the only parties involved are the buyer and the seller.
Your funds are safely escrowed by the smart contracts and only released when
the right conditions are met.

This means there's no central party having custody over any funds, removing the
need for any KYC, minimising fees and preventing loss of funds due to theft.

### On-Chain Dispute Resolution
