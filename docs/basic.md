### No Intermediaries
Once an order is place the only parties involved are the buyer and the seller.
Your funds are safely escrowed by the smart contracts and only released when
the right conditions are met.

This means there's no central party having custody over any funds, removing the
need for any KYC, minimising fees and preventing loss of funds due to theft.
